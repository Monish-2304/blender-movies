        <h4>Sintel</h4>
        <p>
          “Sintel” is an independently produced short film, initiated by the
          Blender Foundation as a means to further improve and validate the
          free/open source 3D creation suite Blender. With initial funding
          provided by 1000s of donations via the internet community, it has
          again proven to be a viable development model for both open 3D
          technology as for independent animation film. This 15 minute film has
          been realized in the studio of the Amsterdam Blender Institute, by an
          international team of artists and developers.

                How often do people make a film where the main character kills
                the thing they were trying to rescue because they didn’t
                recognize it? Not that often. This brought tears to my eyes.

                Breathtaking, I’ve only just begun my blender journey. Making
                something every day until I get to the point I can create
                something on this scale. Pretty amazing short story as well.
                Props all around to all involved in this great piece of work!

                Only the best stories can make you cry, and while I’ve lost
                count how many times I’ve watched this remarkable piece of art
                over the years showing it to people I know, Sintel brings a tear
                to my eye every time. This film is inspiring not only for the
                beautiful story but for the magical quality animation.

                This short film was riveting. The musical overlay was astounding
                and so were the animations. I was bawling like a little kid at
                the end of this video and not many videos are able to do this to
                me.

                I saw this movie a long time ago as a child and it still scars
                me to this day. This is the kind of stuff that should AT THE
                VERY LEAST be played before a movie the way they showed bao
                before The Incredibles 2. These are little masterpieces.

                Wow, at first I thought that it wasn’t that good, nice animation
                and all but not excellent story. Then I saw the end. The feels
                are real. You win Blender Foundation, you win.

                Honestly seeing a story with a sad ending is refreshing, I can
                tell you the ending of 99% of all movies ever made. “Its a happy
                ending”. Its why I like game of thrones and its why I loved
                this.
